# D3-Challenge

For this challenge, I saved the two levels in two different javascript files. In order to view the chart built for the core assignment (pre-bonus), you will need to change the script reference in the html file to point to app.js. To view the bonus plot, you will need to change the script reference in the HTML to read app_bonus.js. 

The main assignment, to create a scatter plot with D3, was fairly straightforward. I used D3 to build the SVG, axes, labels and circles for the chart and called in data from data.csv to populate the chart. 

The bonus added responsiveness to our chart and enabled the user to select which data fields to view in each axis. Each axis can be populated with three different data at the user's discretion by clicking on the labels next to the axes. Mousing over the circles will display a box with the x- and y-axis information of that current plot point.
