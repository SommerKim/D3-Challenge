# Health Report Visualization

I used D3 to build the SVG, axes, labels and circles for the chart and called in data from a CSV to populate the chart. The user can explore the data relationships by selecting which data fields to view in each axis. Each axis can be populated with three different data at the user's discretion by clicking on the labels next to the axes. Mousing over the circles will display a box with the x- and y-axis information of that current plot point.
